# breast-cancer-classifier

## Overview
This project classify breast tumors as malignant or benign using both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. It involved data cleaning, feature extraction, and exploratory data analysis to understand tumor characteristics and feature correlations. 
Multiple models were trained and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Neural Network, and K-Means Clustering. Performance comparison identified Logistic Regression as the most accurate approach, achieving an accuracy of 97% for tumor classification.

## Dataset Source
